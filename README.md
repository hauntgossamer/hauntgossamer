### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

### I'm Haunt (Yes that is my legal name :D)

 ğŸ”­ I recently completed an introductory C++ course and dived into app development using .NET MAUI!
 
 ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning RayLib, C and reverse engineering, as well as creating an App for my business!
 
 ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m working on becoming an asset for a private underground game restoration team
 
 ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for a way to break into the tech space at entry level
 
 ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my love for Python
 
 âš¡ Fun fact: I spent the entirety of my elementary school years as an unspoken tech specialist assitant at every school I went to.
